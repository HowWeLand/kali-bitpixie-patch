# Kali Bitpixie Project

## Overview

This project provides a curated package list for a Kali Linux chroot environment focused on exploiting the Bitpixie vulnerability and applicable 2025 BitLocker CVEs. It forms a minimal but powerful toolkit to facilitate firmware and memory analysis, Windows recovery manipulation, and network reconnaissance needed for modern BitLocker attack vectors.

The goal is to enable security researchers and penetration testers to perform rapid recovery environment exploitation and extract encrypted volume keys from memory without intrusive hardware modifications. This environment also supports flashing-related attacks and forensic analysis essential to emerging attack chains.

The package list is intended as a patch contribution to Kali's live-build repositories, respecting their upstream decision to centralize tooling infrastructure maintenance and avoid fragmentation. Documentation and tooling here aim to complement Kali’s official build workflows.

## Package List with Purpose Annotations

### System & Base Utilities
- `bash`, `coreutils`, `curl`, `wget`, `python3`, `python3-pip`  
  Fundamental Unix utilities, scripting languages, and essential libraries for automation and network operations.
- `sudo`, `nano`, `vim`  
  Privilege escalation and edited text editor tools for interactive chroot environment management.

### Network & Reconnaissance
- `nmap`  
  Network scanner for host discovery, service enumeration, and identifying vulnerable entry points.
- `tcpdump`, `wireshark`  
  Packet capture and analysis to monitor and dissect network communications.
- `netcat`  
  Swiss-army networking tool for TCP/UDP connections useful in custom exploit delivery and listener setups.

### Exploitation Frameworks
- `metasploit-framework`  
  Comprehensive modular framework for launching and managing exploits, payloads, and auxiliary actions.
- `msfpc`  
  Metasploit payload generator supporting diverse payload creation for attack flexibility.

### Forensics & Memory Analysis
- `volatility`, `volatility3`  
  Memory forensics frameworks critical for analyzing live memory dumps, extracting BitLocker keys, and forensic artifact recovery.
- `dmidecode`, `fwupd`  
  System information utilities to assist in firmware investigation and updates.

### Firmware & Flashing Utilities
- `binwalk`  
  Firmware analysis and extraction toolset used for examining and unpacking firmware images.
- `flashrom`  
  Tool to read, write, erase, and verify flash chips; indispensable for flashing-based attack techniques.
- `dd`, `parted`  
  Disk imaging and partition management to facilitate image creation and direct disk manipulation.

### Windows Recovery & PXE Booting
- `syslinux`, `dnsmasq`  
  PXE boot environment setup tools for hosting recovery environment exploits and custom boot loaders.
- `samba`, `wdctl`  
  Windows SMB utilities and Windows Deployment Command Line tools to interface with Windows recovery services.

### Cheat and Reference Tools
- `tealdeer`  
  Simplified and fast cheat sheet tool to quickly reference complex commands during engagements.
- `cht.sh` (via curl wrapper scripts)  
  Online cheat sheet access to dozens of programming and shell commands, accelerating workflow and reducing context switching.

## Future Plans and Hooks

- **Volatility Integration:**  
  Comprehensive integration of Volatility and its plugins in the chroot environment, enabling advanced memory analysis workflows specific to BitLocker and Bitpixie attacks.

- **Cache Warming for cht.sh and Tealdeer:**  
  Implement cache warming and prefetch scripts to improve latency and availability of cht.sh modules. Early module failures are anticipated and acceptable as the cache matures.

- **Flashing Attack Enhancements:**  
  Additional packaging and scripting around firmware flashing workflows will be prepared as attack vectors mature and require more refined flashing tools and Windows PE image customization.

- **Automated Exploitation Wrappers:**  
  Develop modular scripts to automate steps in the Bitpixie exploitation chain and associated BitLocker CVE attack sequences, aiming to reduce manual interaction during penetration tests.

- **Documentation and Workflow Scripts:**  
  Prepare comprehensive user documentation and workflow automation scripts to empower users to conduct BitLocker recovery attacks confidently and repeatably within the Kali Bitpixie environment.
