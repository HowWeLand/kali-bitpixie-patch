# Kali Bitpixie Chroot Packages List
#
# This package list is designed to provide a minimal Kali Linux environment
# tailored for exploiting the Bitpixie vulnerability and related 2025 BitLocker CVEs.
# The selection emphasizes tools for memory analysis, network and system scanning,
# firmware and flashing utilities, Windows recovery manipulation, and forensic analysis.
#
# The environment facilitates rapid recovery environment exploitation, memory key extraction,
# and decryption attacks on BitLocker without requiring invasive hardware modifications.
#
# Future expansions will include volatility integration, cache warming for cht.sh and tealdeer,
# and refined tooling for automated exploitation and post-exploitation workflows.
# 
# There are also considerations for including hardware based attacks at a later, as well as automating the Bitpixie and more complicated 2025 bitlocker CVE processes, as well as packaging in Windows PE creation tools and my own attempts at building better workflow
